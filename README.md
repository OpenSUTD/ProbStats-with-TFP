# Prob&Stats with TensorFlow Probability

This repository is designed to supplement ISTD [50.034 (Introduction to Probability and Statistics)](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate/courses/50034-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics) with some nice visualisations and code things to play with. It does not, and is not intended to, cover all the subject areas of 50.034.

This repository contains **Jupyter Notebooks** that are designed to run on [**Google Colaboratory**](https://colab.research.google.com/), a free Jupyter environment that runs in the cloud. This means that there's nothing to install on your computer!

## Contents

1. Introduction and Normal Distribution [WIP]
2. Special Distributions
3. Bayesian Approach to Coin-flip

## Running the Notebooks

```
TODO
```

**Local Install**

If you want to run the notebooks locally (not recommended if you don't already have a TensorFlow environment set up):

```bash
git clone this-repository
cd this-repository

# install dependencies
pip install tensorflow
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)
jupyter notebook
```

## Contributing

Any relevant contributions are welcome! Feel free to open a pull request. 

**Simple Requirements**

1. Only use "common" libraries
2. Design to run on Google Colab
3. Make an effort to keep code simple and understandable
